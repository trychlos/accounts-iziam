# package-template

## What is it ?

## Configuration

The package's behavior can be configured through a call to the `xx.configure()` method, with just a single javascript object argument, which itself should only contains the options you want override.

## NPM peer dependencies

Starting with v 1.1.0, and in accordance with advices from [the Meteor Guide](https://guide.meteor.com/writing-atmosphere-packages.html#npm-dependencies), we no more hardcode NPM dependencies in the `Npm.depends` clause of the `package.js`. 

Instead we check npm versions of installed packages at runtime, on server startup, in development environment.

Dependencies as of v 1.0.0:
```
```

Each of these dependencies should be installed at application level:
```
    meteor npm install <package> --save
```

## Translations

New and updated translations are willingly accepted, and more than welcome. Just be kind enough to submit a PR on the [Github repository](https://github.com/trychlos/pwix-package-template/pulls).

## Cookies and comparable technologies

`pwix:package-template` may use `localStorage` to record ...

Because this is dynamically done on a per dialog basis, and only on the caller request, the package doesn't advertize of this use, relying on the caller own declaration.
